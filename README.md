LiveBand
========

LiveBand is intended to be a collaborative digital audio workstation (DAW) web application for creating music in the cloud with other musicians. 

Most of the popular desktop DAWs do not have any built-in collaborative features. Now that the Web Audio API and Web MIDI API allow you do things like plug a guitar, keyboard, microphone, etc. directly into your browser (without the need for downloads/plugins), it is possible for a single web app to enable high quality music recording and real-time collaboration over the Web.
